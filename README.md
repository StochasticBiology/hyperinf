# hyperinf
An Ecosystem for Hypercubic Inference in Accumulation Modelling

This package brings together HyperTraPS(-CT), HyperHMM, HyperDAGs and HyperMk, different algorithms for accumulation modelling. All are based around the idea of inferring hypercubic transition graphs that describe the accumulation of binary features.

Wrapper function `hyperinf` produces fitted hypercubic inference models from data; `plot_hyperinf` produces summary plots of the inferred transition graph.
