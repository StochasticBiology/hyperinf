Title: An Ecosystem for Hypercubic Inference in Accumulation Modelling
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Iain Johnston
Maintainer: Iain Johnston <aeioun@gmail.com>
Description: This package brings together HyperTraPS(-CT), HyperHMM, HyperDAGs and HyperMk, different algorithms for accumulation modelling. All are based around the idea of inferring hypercubic transition graphs that describe the accumulation of binary features.
